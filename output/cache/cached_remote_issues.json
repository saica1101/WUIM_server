        "content": "Microsoft has confirmed that Windows 11 System Restore points will be deleted after 60 days, so you need to be more careful and periodically create restore points. This will give you multiple snapshots, but Windows will still delete the oldest ones once they exceed the retention window (now 60 days on Windows 11 24H2 by default).\nIs it more or less than before? It’s hard to tell, really. Ever since\nMicrosoft released the June 2025 update\nwith a new 60-day policy, I’ve been testing different builds of Windows 11 on multiple PCs from varying OEMs to find out how things were before the update.\nSome of my Windows 11 installations’ System Restore would expire after 10 days, but some would stay for up to 90 days.\nMicrosoft’s\nold document\non “System Restore” tells us nothing about the existing retention period. Not even a word. But when digging through the older documentation, I found a\ndocument for Windows Server\ntitled “SystemRestoreConfig class”, dated December 2020, which appears to confirm a 90-day retention period:\nThe time interval for which restore points are preserved, in seconds. When a restore point becomes older than this specified interval, it is deleted. The default age limit is 90 days.\nSince the documentation is from 2020, it’s fair to assume that 90 days is the official System Restore point retention period for Windows 10, Server and older, but after Windows 11’s release in 2021, the retention period has been anywhere between 10 and 90 days (mostly 10 days). Now, it’s changing again for the better.\nIn the release notes of the June 2025 update, Microsoft\nconfirmed\nthat it’s locking the Restore Point to 60 days.\n“After installing the June 2025 Windows security update, Windows 11, version 24H2 will retain system restore points for up to 60 days,” Microsoft announced in a support document. “This 60-day limit will also apply to future versions of Windows 11, version 24H2.”\nAfter installing the update, Windows Latest verified the change to 60 days using the PowerShell command:\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> $key = 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SystemRestore'\r\n>> (Get-ItemProperty -Path $key -Name RPLifeInterval).RPLifeInterval\n5184000\nAs you can see, we’re getting a value of 5184000, which translates to 60 days (5184000 ÷ 86,400 seconds).\nIn case of Windows 10, I’m seeing 7776000 seconds, which translates to 90 days, and it’s in line with older support documents.\nA 13-year-old support document (now deleted) also notes that Windows’ Restore Point was originally designed to expire after 90 days. That was the case in Windows Vista, Windows 7, and later releases. Also, when your device was running low on storage, Windows would delete all restore points in an attempt to free up disk space. This still seems to be the case.\nHow to create a System Restore point in Windows 11\nSystem Restore has always been the “safety net” that lets you roll Windows back after a bad driver, update or app install. To create one, follow these steps (and I recommend creating one after every few weeks):\nOpen Windows Start and search for\nCreate a restore point\n.\nThis will open the\nSystem Protection\ntab in\nSystem Properties\n.\nUnder\nProtection Settings\n, make sure one of the partitions where you intend to create the backup is “protected.”\nSelect the partition and click ‘Configure’ to turn on protection.\nOnce done, click\nCreate\nand follow the on-screen wizard process.\nThis will create a System Restore point with an expiry of 60 days.\nHow often do you create a System Restore point?

        "content": "Can you use .pst files in the new Outlook for Windows 11? Yes, you can, but only some features work. In our tests, Windows Latest observed that Microsoft is slowly catching up with .pst file features in the new Outlook, but most email-related PST tasks are already supported (read, reply, move). Calendar and contact support is next.\nThe new Outlook app for Windows 11 isn’t really liked by users, including businesses, mainly due to missing features like .pst. When new Outlook originally shipped and Microsoft turned off Mail & Calendar, and even started redirecting classic Outlook users, the\nPST support wasn’t there\n. But that has changed over the last few weeks.\nHow to open Outlook Data File (.pst) in new Outlook\nAs per Microsoft’s\nsupport document\nand Windows Latest’s tests, Windows 11’s Outlook allows you to open an Outlook Data File (.pst) from\nSettings\n>\nFiles\n>\nOutlook Data Files\n(see the screenshot below from our PC).\nImage Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nFrom here, you need to select\nAdd file\n, choose a\n.pst file\nand then select\nOpen\n.

You can’t have classic Outlook in 32-bit and new Outlook on 64-bit. Make sure you’ve new Outlook in 64-bit or it won’t work.\nAccording to Microsoft’s roadmap, the most recent release included support for replying and forwarding emails as PST files, which has begun rolling out. In addition, Microsoft has a long lineup planned for PST-related upgrades this year, which will surely include all the missing bits and pieces of the classic Outlook app.\nIn June/July, you can expect multiple feature add-ons like support for PST when forwarding as attachment emails, adding folders from a PST file to favorites, and replying, forwarding, and exporting the mailbox to a PST file in Windows.\nAfter that, July will introduce auto-export support for mailbox to a PST file, and the next month will follow up with adding a read-only access option for calendar and contacts.\nLastly, the new Outlook app will add import support for data files and importing emails from PST files. It’s a jam-packed year for PST-related upgrades in the new Outlook, and hopefully, Microsoft will bring the experience really close to the old app.\nNew .pst features coming to new Outlook on Windows 11\nFeature\nDescription\nStatus\nRollout Start\nExport mailbox to PST\nExport entire mailbox (emails, calendar, contacts) to PST file\nComing\nJune 2025\nAuto-export mailbox to PST\nAutomatically schedule export of mailbox or folders to PST\nComing\nJuly–August 2025\nImport emails from PST\nImport emails stored in PST file into your mailbox\nComing\nSeptember–October 2025\nImport calendars and contacts from PST\nImport calendar events and contacts from PST into mailbox\nComing\nSeptember–October 2025\nRead-only access to calendars in PST\nView calendar data inside PST without importing\nComing\nAugust–September 2025\nRead-only access to contacts in PST\nView contact info inside PST without importing\nComing\nAugust–September 2025\nForward emails in PST as attachment\nSend emails from PST as an attached message\nComing\nAugust 2025\nImport PST support on Mac\nImport PST files into Outlook for Mac\nComing\nOctober 2025\nOutlook now supports offline emails for 30 days\nThe stable version of Outlook had a few minor upgrades recently, such as the ability to sync the offline emails for 30 days compared to the previous 7-day limit.\nYou can also move emails between multiple personal accounts in the app.\nThere are also some Copilot-related announcements, mainly regarding the subscription.

        "article_url": "https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/20/microsoft-to-stop-pushing-older-windows-11-drivers-through-windows-update/",
        "content": "Windows Update will no longer offer older legacy drivers when a newer replacement driver is available on Microsoft’s servers. This change is now rolling out to everyone, but does it mean Windows Update will finally stop replacing newer drivers installed manually via Intel, AMD or Nvidia’s download portals? Unfortunately, not.\nIn a\nsupport document\nfirst spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft describes the policy shift as a “periodic cleanup of drivers from Windows Update.” It’s only meant for OEMs (PC makers and chipmakers).\nI asked Microsoft officials about how it will affect a regular user, and it turns out that most of you will not notice the change unless you really pay attention.\nHow Windows Update will now handle older drivers\nWhen a driver has expired and a newer replacement is available, you will not see the older driver on Windows Update.\n“Technically, expiring a driver means removing all its audience assignments in Hardware Development Center, which stops Windows Update from offering that driver to devices,” Microsoft noted in the support document.\nMicrosoft is only going after legacy drivers, so a regular consumer like you and me will not change anything odd.\nWhat is a legacy driver?\nA legacy driver is simply an old or outdated driver that has a newer and fully compatible version available for the same PC. You don't need the legacy driver when a newer driver is available, so it's being taken down as part of a broader policy shift.\nHowever, when Microsoft expands this cleanup to include expired drivers that have no replacement available, it could result in ‘some drivers not being offered to any systems in the ecosystem.’ For now, the focus is only on legacy drivers that already have newer replacements. Microsoft says plans for other categories will be shared later.\nOEMs can republish the driver when it expires/removed, and Microsoft will bring it back. However, OEMs need to justify why they want an old/expired domain back on Windows Update.\nPreviously, when there were two differently dated drivers for the same product, you might see both of them when you check for Windows Update or one after another. After the policy shift, you’ll only get the most recent driver instead of the older one.\nBut that doesn’t mean the driver will be as up-to-date as the ones offered by OEMs directly.\nNo, it will not improve the Windows 11 driver mess\nYou might wonder why the new policy doesn’t address a classic problem where you install the latest driver from the OEM’s website, but Windows Update replaces it with older versions. Because a Windows Update driver may still have a higher version number compared to the one offered by the driver.\nDrivers via Windows Update rank higher than the drivers from the PC makers since they’re certified by Microsoft for quality and security.\nIt’s also worth noting that the new policy will not hurt people\nrunning Windows 11 on unsupported hardware\n. Do not fall for rumours that suggest Microsoft is making it difficult for unsupported PCs to grab drivers by expiring the older drivers.\nA driver is set to “expire” only when there’s a new replacement available.\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "content": "Image Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nWindows 10 support ends on October 14, 2025, and it\ncan be extended for a year if you pay $30\n. Otherwise, Microsoft will force upgrade supported PCs to Windows 11 whether you like it or not. In case you don’t own a supported PC, you’ll not receive security updates unless you pay, but Microsoft insists you should buy a new AI PC at this point.\nAs first spotted by Windows Latest, in the first and second week of June 2025, Microsoft quietly launched two new campaigns to promote Windows 11. While the\nfirst campaign\nsays Copilot+ PCs and Windows 11 are built for eLearning, the\nsecond rides\non the “Back to School” campaign and insists that Windows 11 is designed for productivity.\nMicrosoft says that the Windows 11 PCs, particularly the Copilot+ PCs, can help students “thrive in and out of the classroom,” and “built-in AI tools” will make life easier. As per the company’s campaign, Windows 11 AI features like Recall and Click to Do are now classified as “productivity” tools.\nWith Recall, you can go back in time because it captures your screen every few seconds and knows what you are doing. Recall understands everything, including people you talk to, files you share, and more.\nAs a result, if you share a file with a friend or a colleague but don’t remember where or the file name, you can type a vague description of the content in Recall AI’s search bar, and it will locate it for you.\nMicrosoft had delayed the Recall AI feature multiple times after security researchers called out the integration as a “privacy nightmare,” but after making it an opt-in and improving privacy controls,\nRecall AI is now included in the stable builds\nof Windows 11 for AI PCs, but\nyou can always disable it\n.\nThe second new AI feature to become productive is called “\nClick to Do\n,” which allows you to perform AI actions on screen, such as blurring photos, removing objects, or looking up information on Bing.\nThen you have “productivity” features like Cocreator in Paint that allow you to use a prompt to turn your imagination into art.\nFor the Back to School campaign, Microsoft is also claiming that these Copilot+ PCs with Windows 11 are up to 47 per cent faster than a recent MacBook Air and offer up to 22 hours of battery backup.\nFull-screen banners take over Windows 10 to promote AI PCs\nFull-screen ad on Windows 10 PC | Image Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nIn addition to internet campaigns,\nMicrosoft is showing full-screen ads promoting Copilot+ PCs\non unsupported hardware.\nI’ve spotted the above full-screen pop-up three times in a span of two months on one of my unsupported virtual machines running Windows 10. As you can see in the above banner, Microsoft says you can do more with a new Windows 11 PC, and it’s time to make the final call.\nMicrosoft also has a new migration tool for Windows 10\nto move everything to a new PC.\n“Want the ultimate Windows 11 experience? Level up to the new Copilot+ PCs – the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever,” Microsoft noted in the campaign.\nBut are these PCs really more productive than Windows 10? Productivity is a subjective term, but if you ask me, Windows 10 does an equally good job. I can see some value in Recall, but it’s not something I’d use regularly.\nWindows 10 still runs perfectly. It supports all your apps and works well even on decades-old hardware, while Windows 11 struggles on older CPUs. With support ending soon, you’ve got about 100 days to decide. Will you pay for Windows 10 extended support or buy a new Copilot+ PC to be more “productive” (pun intended)?\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "content": "Windows 10 KB5063159 (June 16) is an out-of-band update to replace the existing KB5060533 (June 10 2025, Patch Tuesday release) for Surface PCs having issues. According to reports, KB5060533 broke $8,999 Surface Hub devices with a Secure Boot Violation error, so Microsoft pulled the patch and replaced it with KB5063159.\nJune 10’s mandatory security update (KB5060533)\nfor Windows 10 was a disaster on Surface Hub. As per a couple of\nposts on Feedback Hub\n, users pointed out that their Surface Hub fails to boot after applying the recent update.\n“Secure Boot Violation. Invalid signature detected. Check Secure Boot Policy in Setup,” one user\nwrote\nin a Feedback Hub post.\nIn an update to the\nsupport document\non Windows 10 KB5060533, Microsoft later confirmed that some users spotted a Blue Screen of Death error on Surface Hub v1. The company added that two of its other Surface products, Surface Hub 2S and Surface Hub 3, do not run into a Blue Screen error after Windows 10’s June 2025 update.\nFor the affected Surface customers, Microsoft warns, “DO NOT install this update. Instead, install update KB5063159.”\nIn\nanother support document\n, Microsoft explained that it immediately paused the June 2025 update (KB5060533) for Surface Hub v1 after it received reports of Blue Screen of Death errors from users. Later, the company replaced it with a newer/revised version KB5063159, which should no longer crash Surface PCs.\n“This out-of-band update (KB5063159) is offered to Surface Hub v1 devices instead of update KB5060533,” Microsoft noted.\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that KB5063159 is not offered when KB5060533 is already installed on regular PCs, but when KB5060533 is not present, you might be offered KB5063159 instead.\nThankfully, Windows 10 KB5063159 is more or less the same patch except for the exclusive fixes for Surface Hub, so you’ll get all the fixes from the previous release.\n“If you installed earlier updates, only the new updates contained in this package will be downloaded and installed on your device,” the company added.\nJune 2025 Patch Cycle is not looking good for Microsoft\nIt’s worth noting that the June 2025 Update has been a mess for Windows 11 as well.\nJust like Windows 10,\nMicrosoft also replaced\nWindows 11’s June 2025 Patch Tuesday update (\nKB5060842\n) with KB5063060, which started rolling out on June 11. In the case of Windows 11, users reported that their PCs reboot when they try to play games like Fortnite.\nBut\nKB5063060 has its own share of problems\n, including installation issues and, in some cases, it makes it difficult to play games like Fortnite and Counter-Strike, but that appears to be an isolated case.\nThese issues do not just affect regular users. Microsoft also confirmed that some W\nindows Server customers may not be able to use a DHCP server\nacross their organisation after the June 2025 security patch. This issue is still being investigated and Microsoft plans to release an out-of-band update for Windows Server 2025, 2022, 2019 and 2016.\nHow is the most recent update for Windows treating your PC?

        "content": "What if you can’t upgrade to Windows 11 because you own an unsupported PC? You have two options. You can use Microsoft’s paid OneDrive service and save everything to the cloud, which is restored when you set up a new Windows 11 PC. Or you can use a new Windows Migration feature, which comes with a free “PC to PC” transfer feature.\nWith Windows 10 KB5061087, which is rolling out to testers and will reach everyone in the next few days, Microsoft is testing a feature within the\nexisting Windows Backup\n. While it’s not exactly a new app, since it’s been on Windows 10 and 11 for almost two years now, it’s getting a Migration tool.\nAs user Phantom\nnoticed\n, Microsoft quietly updated Windows Backup with an option called “Transfer information to a new PC.” This is visible in Windows 10 Build 19045.6029, but it’s hidden. However, I forced it on, and it warns that the feature is in internal testing, so it’s not supposed to work for regular consumers just yet.\nImage Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nWhile the first option, “Back up this PC,” still works and sends everything to OneDrive, the “Transfer” tool is\nmore like Windows Easy Transfer\n, which helped people on Windows 7 transfer files and settings from an older computer to a new computer using a wired or wireless connection.\nImage Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nWhen you use the second “Windows Migration” option, you see the name of your PC, and are asked to verify whether that is the correct name when you initiate the transfer on your second PC (presumably a new Windows 11 PC).\nMicrosoft also wants both PCs to be on the same network. While it’s not clear if it will be limited to wireless networks, it may also support a wired connection, similar to the old Windows 7 days.\nThe process is very much like how Bluetooth pairing works. A code appears on one PC, and you need to enter it on the other to confirm the connection.\nAfter pairing, Windows will begin copying files and settings, but you’ll be able to choose what you want to transfer.\nMicrosoft has confirmed that a new way to migrate files between PCs is coming\nIn a\nblog post\nfrom May 2025, Microsoft confirmed it was testing a new Windows Migration feature for Windows 11. It didn’t specifically mention Windows 10 in the announcement, but it all makes sense now.\nThe idea of adding a Windows 7 Easy File Transfer-like feature to Windows 10 and 11 is to ease migration.\nIf you can’t get Windows 11, you’ll be asked to replace your old Windows 10 PC and migrate to a new PC. In that case, you can use the new Windows Backup app’s Migration feature.\nWindows Latest also observed that the PC Health app, which is required before upgrading to Windows 11, attempts to run the Windows Backup app, so you can save everything.\nMicrosoft really wants PC owners with unsupported hardware to dump Windows 10 and buy a Windows 11 PC, but will you?\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "content": "Windows 10 KB5060533 is June 2025’s Patch Tuesday release, with a few notable changes and fixes. The good news is that Microsoft has dropped plans to remove seconds from the Calendar flyout and is restoring the feature on PCs\nwhere it was previously removed\n, but there’s a catch. The Calendar UI now includes Bing integration, and it’s here to stay.\nKB5060533 should download and install automatically, since it patches several security issues in the operating system. After installing today’s update, Windows 10 will bump to Build 19044.5965 if you’re on 21H2, and 19045.5965 for those on 22H2 (the last supported version of Windows).\nI opened Windows Update and looked for updates, and it showed up as “2025-06 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems (KB5060533)” with an option to install, since it had already finished downloading the files. It’s a small update that takes less than two minutes to download and another two to three minutes to install.\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that the Calendar flyout (the sheet that expands from the taskbar when you tap the date and time) now shows seconds again.\nIt also features a new “rich experience,” according to Microsoft.\nAs part of this, images are now displayed for all popular events.\nFor example, if you open May 16th, which is International Light Day, you’ll see lightbulb icons next to the date and time in the flyout.\nIt looks nice, and I’m not complaining, but when you tap an event image, it performs a Bing.com search for the event name in Microsoft Edge. Your default search engine choice isn’t respected, and Windows Calendar always sends you to Bing.com in Edge.\nThe UI doesn’t imply that Bing is integrated into Calendar when you’re hovering over the event images or browsing events. It’s only when you tap on the event image, assuming it to be an interactive widget inside Calendar UI, that you realise it’s a Bing link in disguise.\nI couldn’t find any setting to disable Bing’s event generation. This change is also not documented anywhere. Microsoft calls the update a “rich calendar experience,” and it’s the end of the story.\nWhile Bing itself isn’t bad and I actually prefer it over Google, Microsoft’s decision to quietly sneak Bing into the Calendar flyout might not sit well with users.\nThis change will be turned on for users gradually after installing Windows 10 KB5060533 (June security patch).\nBing slides into Windows 10 as OS bites the OS in October\nIt’s also ironic because Microsoft pulled Bing out of the hat when Windows 10 has only four security updates left.\nThe OS loses support on October 14, 2025, unless you pay\n$30 for a year’s worth of extended security updates\n. Microsoft is urging users to make the switch.\nYou either keep using unprotected Windows 10, upgrade to Windows 11 or dump the OS for an alternative. But how many consumers will dump Windows for another operating system remains to be seen.\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "content": "Copilot isn’t popular, but it still does a pretty good job of offering some ChatGPT features for free with censorship and restrictions. Right now, Copilot’s Think Deeper feature uses the o3-mini-high model with knowledge cut off in October 2023, but Microsoft now appears to be A/B testing the o4-mini-high (or the regular o4-mini) model.\nBy default, Copilot has two modes or three (Deep Research) if you pay for the $20 Copilot Pro subscription. One is Quick Response, which uses one of OpenAI’s regular models, and the other is “Think Deeper,” a reasoning model. In March 2025, Microsoft\nconfirmed\nthe “Think Deeper” toggle turns on o3-mini-high, one of the premium OpenAI models.\n“Think Deeper’s reasoning model has been upgraded to OpenAI’s o3-mini (high). This means you’ll wait less to get answers,” Microsoft\nnoted\nin the March 2025 release notes.\no3-mini-high has a knowledge cut off of October 2023, and it’s no longer offered with ChatGPT Plus, Pro or Teams/Enterprise. OpenAI has already replaced the model with o4-mini-high, and Microsoft is also following the move.\nMicrosoft Copilot briefly replaced the o3-mini-high with o4-mini-high (or o4-mini)\nSee the screenshot below when I asked Copilot’s Think Deeper what the knowledge cut-off date is, and it clearly says October 2023 with absolute confidence. This confirms it’s still on o3-mini-high in this particular session:\nThis session is using o3-mini-high, see the cut off date, and also pay attention to the mode I selected | Image Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nBut when I used one of my Microsoft accounts and asked Copilot what its knowledge cut-off date is with Think Deeper turned on, it told me that the training data goes up until June 2024.\nThis session is on o4-mini-high (or some other model with June 2024 cut off). Again, I’m using Think Deeper | Image Courtesy: WindowsLatest.com\nBased on our tests and other findings, it does appear to be the o4-mini-high model, which has a knowledge cut-off in June 2024. It could also be o4-mini, but I’m assuming it’s o4-mini-high because Microsoft has used the “-high” variant for Copilot’s o3-mini integration.\nKnowledge cut-off dates we have for OpenAI models:\no3-mini / o3-mini-high: October 1, 2023\no3: June 1, 2024\no4-mini / o4-mini-high: June 1, 2024\nGPT-4.1 family (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano): June 2024\nIs it possible that “Think Deeper” could be using o3, which also has a knowledge cutoff of June 2024? I don’t think so. It’s an expensive model, and it would not make sense to replace the 30-second “Think Deeper” with that, but it cannot be ruled out with 100% confidence.\nAccording to OpenAI\n, o4-mini does significantly better than the predecessor, but it’s still cheaper. For example, on the AIME math tests, o3-mini scored about 87% on the 2024 exam and 86.5% on 2025, whereas o4-mini scored about 93.4% in 2024 and 92.7% in 2025.\nAs for the “-high” variant, compared to o3-mini-high, the o4-mini-high variant spends more time “thinking,” which improves its quality.\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "article_url": "https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/18/microsoft-edge-tests-ai-overhauled-msn-feed-with-ads-but-you-can-turn-it-off/",
        "content": "Microsoft Edge has been testing a new “\nCopilot mode\n” that replaces the current New Tab Page with a Copilot-powered compose box. This lets you switch between the Bing search and Copilot search. Below the Compose box, you’ll see the same old MSN feed, but it’s now curated by Copilot/AI.\nWhile testing Microsoft Edge’s new Copilot, we noticed a new AI/Copilot-powered MSN feed. The AI overhaul of MSN isn’t bad. We found the new layout quite spacious, considering a 2K resolution monitor.\nIt is less congested than the MSN feed integrated in the stable version, with adequate empty space on both sides of the feed.\nIf you compare the screenshots of the Edge stable and Edge Canary MSN feeds below with the new Copilot page, the latter is less distracting. This is the type of layout Microsoft must ensure in the future if it wants to make the launch page of the browser easier to navigate.\nAds and AI-curated content\nHowever, the good things about this new overhaul stop here.\nLike the old feed, this one also integrates one common component–ads. We spotted a few ad tiles with the “sponsored” label on them while scrolling down the feed. They don’t offer any option to hide the sponsored content and retain only the MSN feed cards.\nYou can report the ad if you want to, but that doesn’t stop the ads from appearing.\nThere are also Copilot-curated cards amidst the regular cards that produce an overview of a topic published on the web. The screenshot below showcases a JBL speaker-related curated card that mentions the sources at the bottom while dedicating a huge portion of the card to the banner image.\nIf you don’t find the overall AI infusion exciting and want to get rid of it, Edge offers a solution. You can turn off the feed from this new Copilot page for a cleaner look.\nJust click on the Settings icon and turn off the\nShow feed\ntoggle to achieve a clean look. However, we would appreciate it if there were a way to get rid of the sponsored content or turn off the Copilot curated cards.\nSince the\nCopilot labs\nsection is in testing phase, these options would evolve by the time they ship to the stable channel.\nWe currently control these settings using flags, but we expect dedicated settings and options to customize the new Copilot launch page.\nMicrosoft previously confirmed that it’s testing a New Tab page in Edge 137 with Copilot\n, but that implementation is believed to be different from what we are seeing here.\nOther AI features coming to Microsoft Edge\nIn addition,\nEdge is testing Phi-4 model integration\n, and\nsome users\nalso spotted a new Quick Action mode that opens Copilot in the address bar (as you can see in the above screenshot\nshared\nby Leo).\nWhat do you think about Edge’s Copilot overhaul?

        "article_url": "https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/17/microsoft-dhcp-issue-hits-kb5060526-kb5060531-of-windows-server/",
        "content": "Microsoft confirmed that the DHCP server service might stop responding or refuse to connect after the\nJune 2025 Update\nfor Windows Server. The DHCP issue affects Windows Server 2025 (\nKB5060842\n), Windows Server 2022 (KB5060526), Windows Server 2019 (KB5060531), and Windows Server 2016 (KB5061010).\nAs per user reports spotted by Windows Latest, as soon as you install Windows Server 2016 (KB5061010) or another update listed above, you won’t be able to use the DHCP server. The DHCP server connection would immediately fail after 20-50 seconds of booting the server, but as soon as you remove the update, you’ll be able to use DHCP again.\n“Can confirm this is a very unpleasant irritant in our environment since patching last week. DHCP clients lose their leases. We are not running DHCP on our DCs, for what that’s worth. Server 2022,” one of the affected users wrote in a forum post.\n“I proactively declined KB5061010, KB5060531, KB5060526 and KB5060842 on my DCs, some of which provide DHCP services,” another added.\nServer admins use DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to devices in a network, so the devices (employees of the organisation) can connect to the internet and access other systems in the network. It’s used in offices, schools, and other places, including governments.\nIn response, Microsoft confirmed via a support ticket that the issue is being investigated.\n“The DHCP Server service might intermittently stop responding after installing this security update. This issue affects IP renewal for clients,” the company\nnoted\n.\nWindows Latest received the response via a support ticket, but as of June 16, Microsoft has already updated its support documentation to confirm DHCP issues.\n“We are working on releasing a resolution in the coming days and will provide more information when it is available,” the company wrote in an updated support document.\nWindows Latest understands that Microsoft will be releasing a standalone update for all affected versions of Windows Server via Update Catalog. If you’re affected due to a DHCP problem, you’ll be able to download the .msu file and manually patch it. Next month’s update will come with the patch applied.\nThere’s a second known issue where CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) text won’t render properly when displayed at 96 DPI or scaling is set to 100%.\nMicrosoft is looking into the root cause, which appears to have been caused by Google Chromium updates. If you’re affected and have one of these languages, you’ll see blurry text in Edge, Chrome or other browsers.\nHow to fix DHCP issues after the June 2025 Windows Server updates?\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that only removing the patch helps with DHCP issues, but again, it’ll leave your PC vulnerable to June 2025 exploits.\nIn any case, if you still want to remove the update and use DHCP, open Settings > Windows Update > Update History, and identify the KB number. Note it down, but it should be one of them, depending on the Server you use:\nWindows Server 2025 (KB5060842), Windows Server 2022 (KB5060526), Windows Server 2019 (KB5060531), and Windows Server 2016 (KB5061010).\nOn the Update history page, select Uninstall updates, and click “Uninstall” next to the applied patch you want to remove.\nAfter removing the patch, schedule a reboot of the system, and you should be able to use DHCP again.\nWindows Server users aren’t alone.\nWindows 11 consumer edition also has its own share of problems\n.\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "article_url": "https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/16/windows-11-kb5063060-issues-install-fails-on-windows-11-24h2-for-some-users/",
        "content": "Windows 11 KB5063060 is failing to install due to errors like 0x800f0922, 0x80070002, 0x80070306, and 0x800f0991. It’s also causing other issues for some users, including problems when playing games.\nWindows 11 KB5063060 is June 2025 Patch Tuesday’s second update because the original patch “\nKB5060842\n” was\nreplaced after it caused issues with Easy Anti-Cheat\n(Fortnite’s anti-cheat engine).\nSeveral users told me that Windows 11 KB5063060 will not install or get stuck at downloading. In a\npost\non Feedback Hub, one user mentioned that KB5063060 does not complete boot, shows 100% complete, do not power off the system, with the dots circling. “Since I can not get into Windows, I can’t find any errors,” one of the affected users noted.\n“Update is not pushing through upon reaching 38%, but the rollback is successful. The error code resulted in 0x800f0922,” another user wrote.\nI’m really not surprised, since nearly every Windows update causes installation issues for a small number of users. But this time, the June 2025 update is a mess. There are two different cumulative updates, and Windows gets stuck when it detects KB5063060 after already starting to download KB5060842.\nInstall error 0x800f0922 | Image via:\nReddit\nIf your Windows Update is struggling to install the June 2025 Update, I recommend downloading the .msu file of KB5063060 from\nMicrosoft Update Catalog\n. This will go through smoothly, but remember that there might be other issues that could pop up after installing the June 2025 Update.\nRemember that KB5063060 is required for Easy Anti-Cheat-based games to work properly if you installed recent updates.\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that when KB5060842 (now removed from Windows Update) is installed, you might run into problems when playing games like Fortnite. Your PC might restart automatically when you launch Fortnite, but the issue is believed to be fixed in KB5063060.\nWindows 11 KB5063060 issues affect performance, crash features and more\nOne of our readers, Andrew, told Windows Latest that Windows 11 June 2025 Update “broke their machine” with a bug that crashes the taskbar when waking up the PC from sleep.\n“Taskbar along the whole bottom of the machine is frozen,” Andrew told me over email.\n“The mouse functions above and can interact with desktop docs/icons, but the task bar was basically like a picture as opposed to live icons to interact with. Luckily, I did figure out how to uninstall it. The update was listed under the “uninstall” list and removing it fixed things. I’ve paused updates for a couple of weeks.”\n“Whatever was installed overnight 6/11/25 caused my computer to load Windows, Explorer crashed, Explorer reloaded, Explorer crashed. It was too fast to do anything, so I just had to wipe and install the backup. I’ll be passing on this one,” another user wrote in Windows Latest’s comments section.\nPlayers who hoped this re-issued patch would solve Easy Anti-Cheat headaches are also frustrated.\nFor example, one user told us that they installed the update, but their games, like Fortnite, still crash. In the case of Counter-Strike, a fresh install of KB5063060 causes a full machine freeze.\nIn a\nReddit thread\ndiscussing Windows Latest’s coverage of Windows 11 KB5063060, one user pointed out that they’ve also run into anti-cheat errors in eFootball 25 after the patch.\nBut are the issues just limited to games or performance? I don’t think so. One user points out that the external monitor turns an ugly purple-green over HDMI on a Lenovo Legion and clears up the moment the update is rolled back.\nWhile another flags issues with how Bluetooth works in Windows 11 24H2 after recent update:\n“After installing KB5063060 and restarting my computer, my Bluetooth devices are no longer detected. I have to re-add every Bluetooth device every time my computer starts up. After a couple restarts, I have 3 of each of my Bluetooth devices listed in Control Panel. I tried to remove the old Bluetooth devices but it fails without any error message and provides the option to remove the device again. Uninstalling KB5063060 resolved the issue.”\nIn a separate post, a business user noted that they install Windows updates on hundreds of PCs regularly, but after installing Windows 11 KB5063060, they’re unable to go into audit/admin mode.\n“To get into admin mode, we have to send the unit to sleep, then awaken. The unit will now respond to Ctrl Shift F3 and go into admin mode. We are currently no longer installing this emergency update.”\nIt’s a mess for some users, but the majority of consumers should not run into any of these problems.\nAccording to the official release notes, Microsoft is not aware of any new issues with Windows 11’s June 2025 Update. One of the known issues that automatically reboots Windows when playing Fortnite-like games is now solved.\nPer Microsoft, you might still run into blurry or unclear CJK texts in certain regions like Korea and Japan.\nWhat to do if you’ve issues after the Windows 11 June 2025 Update?\nUnfortunately, if you’re having issues after the Windows 11 June 2025 Updates, there’s nothing you can do but wait for Microsoft to figure out what went wrong and patch it in the next cumulative update. Most issues typically get patched in future updates, even when Microsoft doesn’t acknowledge problems.\nBut if you can’t wait and have issues after Windows 11 KB5063060, open\nSettings\n>\nWindows Update\n>\nUpdate\nHistory\n>\nUninstall updates\n.\nIdentify the patch and uninstall the patch. If you don’t have KB5063060, but still have issues, look for KB5060842 and install that instead, as these two updates are the same at the end of the day.\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"

        "article_url": "https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/15/user-calls-windows-11-pure-horror-microsoft-says-its-listening-to-feedback/",
        "content": "Windows 11 is far from perfect, but some users truly hate the upgrade, which will become mandatory for everyone starting October 14, 2025. In a post on X, a user who switched to Fedora called Windows 11 “pure horror,” and responding to the criticism, Microsoft’s Insider Program head promised the company is paying close attention to the feedback.\n“I have a deep urge to tell you that I hated Windows more and more from 8 onwards (10 was slightly better, 11 is pure horror) to the point that I bit the bullet and switched to Fedora more than a year ago. I am not coming back,”\nsays\na user who dumped Windows for Fedora.\n“Privacy, bloat, performance, bugs and UI/UX sums it up pretty much. Start Menu search used to be fast and snappy (one example). Tbf, some things (control panel) improved a bit from Win 10 to 11. But other than that.. BOY is there some work ahead of y’all,” the upset Microsoft user added, who continues to use Windows at work.\nBrandon LeBlanc, Senior Program Manager on the Windows Insider Program, replied and\nsaid\nhe was “sorry to hear we lost you with Windows 11” and hopes they can win the user back “in time.” He even called Fedora his “favourite Linux distro.”\n“Again, I do hope we can work hard to improve Windows and bring you back,” Brandon added in a follow-up\npost on X\n.\nWindows 11 isn’t the best operating system and has many issues, but that was a nice way to deal with criticism.\nIt does look like Microsoft is open to feedback on some fronts, but is that enough?\nMicrosoft does listen to feedback, but not always\nWe’ve seen several features gradually improve on Windows 11. For example, most Control Panel features have now migrated to Settings, including the fonts page.\nIn addition, the Settings page now lets you manage the time server powering the Time sync from Date & Time settings, which was previously exclusive to Control Panel.\nControl Panel migration is still a work in progress, but Settings is clearly in a better shape than it was on Windows 10, as long as you ignore ads for Copilot Pro or Microsoft 365 on the homepage.\nMore recently,\nMicrosoft added a toggle to turn off the Recommended feed in the Start menu settings\nand introduced a new design built with feedback from Windows Insiders and passionate Microsoft fans.\nAs you can see in the screenshot below, Windows 11’s new Start menu has a category layout where apps are grouped together. It looks a bit like live tiles, but the icons are still static.\nMicrosoft argues that it listened to feedback for building the new Start menu. The company collected points from true Windows fans using the Feedback Hub, coffee chats and remote interviews.\nFor example, Microsoft created layouts in Figma and on paper, then tested prototypes with over 300 fans to make sure the experience stays smooth, so even a beginner can instantly get familiar with Windows.\n“Over 300 Windows 11 fans joined unmoderated studies and dozens more hopped into live co-creation calls. We watched eye-tracking heat maps swirl, counted scroll wheels, and listened for “oh!”s of delight to know where we were hitting the mark,” the company\nnoted\n.\n“Together we’ll keep the promise of Start alive: everything you need, right here, ready when you are.”\nWhy do some people truly dislike Windows 11?\nLike I mentioned, Windows 11 has its own share of problems, which might be annoying for some users to dislike the OS.\nIn addition to strict hardware requirements and performance issues, many users dislike Windows 11 because it aggressively promotes Edge and Bing, as\nWindows Latest has spotted in the past\n.\nI doubt Microsoft will push that hard again. Those ads and promotions peaked when Windows was briefly headed by the former Bing head, but that’s not the case now, which is why you might not see ads like the one in the screenshot below anymore:\nA Bing-pop-up on the taskbar\nHow the change of leadership and organization shake-up led to more Bing/Copilot ads in Windows is a story for another day.\nBut what feature do you really dislike in Windows 11? For me, it’s that you can’t move the taskbar, and I doubt that option will ever return. What about you?

        "content": "Microsoft wants you to be on the right side of risk (history) and stop using Windows 10 as soon as possible because Windows 11 is not only better, but also safer and secure. That’s according to a new Microsoft advertisement on YouTube, which also encourages people (particularly business customers) to look for Intel vPro-powered Windows 11 PCs.\nWindows 10 support ends on October 14, 2025 and we all know it. As the end of support approaches, Microsoft is doubling down on its efforts to migrate as many people as possible, but we aren’t seeing any uptick in the numbers yet.\nWindows 11 is growing, but at a slow rate and if it maintains the same pace, a significant number of users would remain on Windows 10 when the operating system loses support on October 14, 2025. Microsoft wants that to change, and it’s hopeful the new advertisement will help.\nMicrosoft's anti Windows 10 campaign\n1\nof 4\nIn a 30-second clip, Microsoft warns users to “Stay on the right side of risk”, which means that once Windows 10 stops getting security patches, any new vulnerabilities will go unpatched.\nBy upgrading to Windows 11 Pro on Intel vPro, you get hardware-level protections (like Intel’s hardware root of trust and Windows 11’s secure kernel) that block threats.\nWith all these advertisements and pop-ups inside Windows 10, Microsoft is hoping that users will understand that moving off Windows 10 and upgrading to Windows 11 keeps them on the “safe” side.\nWindows 10 continues to dominate desktop market share\nAccording to StatCounter, Windows 10 has about 53.2 % of the desktop market share. For comparison, Windows 11 is at 43.23%.\nMonth-Year\nMac OS X 10.14 (%)\nWindows 10 (%)\nWindows 7 (%)\nWindows 8.1 (%)\nJan 2020\n3.12\n57.08\n25.56\n3.38\nAs you can see in the above data curated by Netmarketshare (a data analytics firm that no longer operates), Windows 7 held about 25% of the desktop OS market at the end of January 2020 (when Windows 7 support officially ended on January 14).\nWindows 10 already held about 57.08 % of the desktop market when Windows 7’s end-of-support date loomed. In contrast, as of May 2025, Windows 11 sits at roughly 43.2%.\nWindows market share (May 2025)\nPercentage Market Share\nWin10\n53.2%\nWin11\n43.23%\nWin7\n2.47%\nWinXP\n0.54%\nWin8.1\n0.29%\nWin8\n0.21%\nWindows 10 still has about three months of support left, so things might change a lot in the next three to five months. However, I’m not expecting a major decline in Windows 10 share because\npeople can always pay $30 for another year and extend support\nor keep using the operating system without security updates.\nWhat about you? Do you plan to dump Windows 10 in favour of Windows 11 before October 2025 and be on the right side of the “risk”? Or if you’ve already made the switch, do you still miss Windows 10?\nComments\nShare\nNewsletter\nSubscribe\nManage Push Notifications\nAll\nUpdate\nSubscribe Push notifications\nSupport independent blog\nSupport on Ko-Fi\nSupport on Patreon\nForums\nPost\nShare\nDiscord"
